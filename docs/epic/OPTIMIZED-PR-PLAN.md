# PAI-OpenCode v3.0 — Corrected PR Plan

**Based on:** Full repository audit + live v4.0.3 upstream comparison (2026-03-08)
**Goal:** Accurate representation of remaining work (2 PRs remaining until v3.0)

> Most PAI Tools and many docs were already ported in earlier WPs.
> See `TODO-v3.0.md` PR #C section for the verified remaining task list.

### 📋 PR #C: WP5 — Core PAI System Completion (CRITICAL)

**Branch:** `feature/wp-c-core-pai-system` (new from `dev`)
**Estimate:** ~21 tasks, ~3–3.5h
**Dependencies:** PR #A ✅

> [!NOTE]
> **Verified against v4.0.3 upstream** — the task list below reflects only confirmed gaps.
> Many items from the original plan were already done in earlier WPs.

```text
PHASE 1 — Structural fixes (flatten nested skills):
├── skills/USMetrics/USMetrics/ → flatten to skills/USMetrics/
│   (move Tools/, Workflows/, merge SKILL.md, delete inner dir)
└── skills/Telos/Telos/ → flatten to skills/Telos/
    (move DashboardTemplate/, ReportTemplate/, Tools/, Workflows/, delete inner dir)

PHASE 2 — Missing skill content (port from v4.0.3):
├── skills/Utilities/AudioEditor/     (SKILL.md + Tools/ + Workflows/)
├── skills/Utilities/Delegation/      (SKILL.md only)
├── skills/Research/MigrationNotes.md
├── skills/Research/Templates/        (MarketResearch.md, ThreatLandscape.md)
├── skills/Agents/ClaudeResearcherContext.md
└── skills/Utilities/SKILL.md         (update: add AudioEditor + Delegation entries)

PHASE 3 — Missing PAI/ flat docs (9 files, port + sed-replace .claude→.opencode):
├── CLI.md
├── CLIFIRSTARCHITECTURE.md
├── DOCUMENTATIONINDEX.md
├── FLOWS.md
├── PAIAGENTSYSTEM.md
├── README.md
├── SYSTEM_USER_EXTENDABILITY.md
├── THEFABRICSYSTEM.md
└── THENOTIFICATIONSYSTEM.md

PHASE 3b — Missing PAI/ subdirectories (3 dirs, port + sed-replace):
├── ACTIONS/   (A_EXAMPLE_FORMAT/, A_EXAMPLE_SUMMARIZE/, lib/, pai.ts, README.md)
├── FLOWS/     (README.md)
└── PIPELINES/ (P_EXAMPLE_SUMMARIZE_AND_FORMAT.yaml, README.md)

PHASE 4 — PAI Tools:
└── BuildCLAUDE.ts → BuildOpenCode.ts  (copy + replace .claude→.opencode, CLAUDE.md→AGENTS.md)
    Note: All other PAI Tools already present and identical to v4.0.3 ✅

PHASE 5 — Bootstrap & index:
├── MINIMAL_BOOTSTRAP.md  (fix USMetrics path, add AudioEditor + Delegation)
└── bun GenerateSkillIndex.ts
```

**Completion checklist:**
- [ ] `bun run skills:validate`
- [ ] `bun run skills:index`
- [ ] `biome check --write .`
- [ ] `bun test`
- [ ] PR against `dev`

### 📋 PR #D: WP6 — Installer & Migration + DB Health (CRITICAL)

**Branch:** `feature/wp-d-installer-migration` (new from `dev` after #C merges)
**Estimate:** ~18 files, ~1300 lines
**Dependencies:** PR #C

```text
PAI-Install/ (port from v4.0.3, adapt for OpenCode):
├── install.sh           (~/.claude/ → ~/.opencode/, CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md)
├── cli/
├── engine/
├── electron/            ← Required for v3.0 + DB Health tab integrated here
├── web/
└── main.ts

DB Health (WP-F — integrated):
├── plugins/handlers/session-cleanup.ts  (extend: checkDbHealth())
├── plugins/lib/db-utils.ts              (getDbSizeMB, getSessionsOlderThan)
├── Tools/db-archive.ts                  (standalone: archive/vacuum/restore)
└── .opencode/commands/db-archive.ts     (OpenCode custom command /db-archive)

Migration & Docs:
├── tools/migration-v2-to-v3.ts
├── UPGRADE.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── docs/DB-MAINTENANCE.md
└── README.md (update)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Electron GUI is required for v3.0** — CLI installer AND Electron GUI both required

## ⚙️ Architecture Decision: Plugin Consolidation

> [!TIP]
> **Decided 2026-03-06 — Option B: Pragmatic**

**Option A (Epic goal):** Dissolve all 19 handlers, native OpenCode events, ~300 lines
**Option B (Chosen):** Handler modules remain as "internal modules", only add missing hooks

**Rationale for Option B:**
- Lower risk (no complete restructuring)
- Functionality guaranteed preserved
- Less effort (~1 day vs ~2 days)
- True consolidation deferred to **v3.1**

**Consequence:** `pai-unified.ts` stays as coordinator over handler modules. New hooks added as new handler files and imported in `pai-unified.ts`.
