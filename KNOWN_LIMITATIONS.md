# Known Limitations (v2.0.0)

This document lists features from upstream PAI that are not portable to OpenCode, limitations of the current implementation, and optional features.

---

## Not Portable (Claude Code Only)

These features exist in Daniel Miessler's PAI but depend on Claude Code-specific APIs that have no OpenCode equivalent:

### Agent Teams / Swarm
- **Upstream:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` enables coordinated multi-agent with shared task lists
- **OpenCode:** No equivalent experimental API. Use the standard Task tool for parallel agent spawning instead.
- **Workaround:** Launch multiple Task tool calls in a single message for parallel execution

### Plan Mode
- **Upstream:** `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` built-in tools provide structured read-only exploration with approval checkpoint
- **OpenCode:** No equivalent built-in tools. The PLAN phase still runs — it just doesn't have the structured workshop.
- **Workaround:** Perform equivalent exploration using Glob, Grep, Read directly in the conversation flow

### StatusLine
- **Upstream:** Real-time status display in Claude Code UI showing current phase, criteria progress, etc.
- **OpenCode:** No TUI status line API. Phase progression is tracked via voice curls and Algorithm output.
- **Status:** Investigating potential OpenCode TUI extensions

## v2.0.0 Specific

### Prompt Caching
- **Upstream:** Claude Code uses Anthropic's prompt caching natively for SKILL.md and context files
- **OpenCode:** Zen provider has automatic similarity-based caching (70-90% hit rate, 5min TTL). Anthropic direct requires manual `cache_control` in API calls.
- **Impact:** Token costs may be slightly higher without explicit caching on Anthropic provider

---

## Optional Features (Not Required)

### Skill Customizations
- System exists at `.opencode/skills/CORE/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/`
- Not populated by default — skills work without customizations
- **Setup:** Create customization files as needed per skill

### Voice Server
- Voice notifications work with multiple backends:
  - ElevenLabs via Voice Server (if running on localhost:8888)
  - Google Cloud TTS (if credentials configured)
  - macOS `say` command (automatic fallback)
- **All fallbacks are graceful** — no errors if services unavailable

### Wisdom Frames
- 5 seed domain frames shipped (development, deployment, security, architecture, communication)
- The Algorithm reads and writes to these automatically
- **Optional:** Add custom domain frames to `MEMORY/WISDOM/` for your specific work domains

### Observability Dashboard
- Event logging to `/tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log` works
- Vue 3 dashboard available but deprecated (significant dependency overhead)
- Server-side JSONL event logging remains unaffected

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading?
```bash
# Check plugin log
tail -f /tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log

# Verify plugin exists
ls -la .opencode/plugins/pai-unified.ts
```

### Context not injected?
```bash
# Check context files exist
ls -la .opencode/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/
ls -la .opencode/skills/CORE/USER/DAIDENTITY.md
```

### Voice notifications not working?
Voice notifications are optional and fail gracefully if:
- Voice Server not running on localhost:8888
- Google Cloud TTS not configured
- Not on macOS (for `say` fallback)

```bash
grep -i voice /tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log
```

### Security validator blocking legitimate commands?
The security validator blocks dangerous patterns by design. In v2.0.0, it also strips env var prefixes (`export`, `set`, `declare`, `readonly`) before scanning to prevent false positives.
