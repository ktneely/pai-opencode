/**
 * Last Response Cache Handler
 *
 * Ported from PAI v4.0.3 LastResponseCache.hook.ts
 * Triggered by: message.updated (assistant role, event bus)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Caches the last assistant response text to disk so RatingCapture
 * (which fires on user message) can access the previous response
 * for context-aware rating analysis.
 *
 * This bridges the gap where the rating arrives AFTER the response —
 * RatingCapture needs to know WHAT it's rating.
 *
 * STORAGE: MEMORY/STATE/last-response.txt (max 2000 chars, trimmed)
 *
 * @module last-response-cache
